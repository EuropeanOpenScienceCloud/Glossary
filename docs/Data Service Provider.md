# Data Service Supplier

**Definition:** an [EOSC] Supplier focusing on the provision of one or more Data Services, i.e. building blocks enacting the implementation and provisioning of an [EOSC] Service.

**Notes:** The services these suppliers are expected to contribute represent a specific typology of service whose value resides more on the data it gives access to than on the functionality it offers. One of the primary service built by relying on Data Services is the [EOSC Data Registry] Data Re service typology.
