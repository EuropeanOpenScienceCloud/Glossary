# EOSC Rules of Participation    

**Definition:** the principles defined by the EOSC Governance to drive the processes enacting an actor to play the role of EOSC System User (and any specialization of it).

*Note:* Multiple typologies of roles (see EOSC System Users) are envisaged in EOSC. It is likely that multiple typologies of Rules of Participation will be developed to capture the specific participation requirements posed for actors expected to play a certain role. For instance, the requirements actors willing to be EOSC Service Provider have to face and satisfy are diverse from the requirements actors willing to be EOSC End-users have to face and satisfy.
