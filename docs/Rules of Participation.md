# EOSC Rules of Participation    

**Definition:** the principles defined by the [EOSC Governance](EOSC Governance.md) to drive the processes enacting an actor to play the role of [EOSC System User](EOSC System User.md) (and any specialization of it).

*Note:* Multiple typologies of roles (see [EOSC System User](EOSC System User.md)s) are envisaged in [EOSC](EOSC). It is likely that multiple typologies of Rules of Participation will be developed to capture the specific participation requirements posed for actors expected to play a certain role. For instance, the requirements actors willing to be [EOSC Service Provider](EOSC Service Provider.md) have to face and satisfy are diverse from the requirements actors willing to be [EOSC End-users](EOSC End-users.md) have to face and satisfy.
