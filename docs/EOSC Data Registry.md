# EOSC Data Registry

**Definition:** an [EOSC](EOSC) Service providing [EOSC System Users](EOSC System Users) with a list of live / ready-to-use descriptions of datasets (a specific type of EOSC Resource) offered by the EOSC System.

*Notes:* Datasets do not occur per-se / on their own, rather they are made available by EOSC Service(s). Many EOSC Data Registry instances may exist, each tailored to serve the needs of a designated community. Moreover, an overarching EOSC Data Registry is likely to be built / populated by relying on EOSC Service Component(s) including thematic catalogues, registries and repositories. Every entry of an EOSC Data Registry must give relevant information (aka metadata) on the listed datasets thus to enact its informed discovery and use, e.g. a description of dataset intent and scope, a description on how to access it, a description of the license governing its usage.
