# EOSC Architecture

**Definition:** the architecture of the [EOSC System](EOSC System.md). The service-oriented architecture consists of the [EOSC Services](EOSC Service.md) forming the [EOSC System](EOSC System.md). The deployment architecture consists of the [EOSC Nodes](EOSC Node.md) contributing to the [EOSC System](EOSC System.md).

*Notes:* Every “system” has its own architecture. According to ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 the architecture of a system is "fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in the principles of its design and evolution".
